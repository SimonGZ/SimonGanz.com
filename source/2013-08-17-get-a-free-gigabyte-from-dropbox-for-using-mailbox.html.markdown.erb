Free space on [Dropbox][] is worth its weight in gold. You get to keep it forever, and every additional megabyte postpones the day when you'll have to switch to their [$100-a-year paid plan][0719-001].

Thankfully, this week Dropbox is giving away free space if you try their iOS Gmail client, [Mailbox][0719-002] (also free). If you have an iOS device, [download the app][0719-003], go to settings, and link it to your Dropbox account. You get the free gig of space immediately.
