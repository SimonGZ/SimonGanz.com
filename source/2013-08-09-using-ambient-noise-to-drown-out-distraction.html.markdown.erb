I struggle to work in silence. My mind gets crowded with ideas. But I also struggle to work with music. My mind begins to follow the lyrics.

Ambient noise is a way to drown out your thoughts without distracting your focus. Here are three tools I recommend:

## SimplyNoise

[SimplyNoise][0080-001] is a site that plays [white, pink, and brown noise][wikipedia]. There are many sites and many apps that do this, but in my opinion, SimplyNoise has the "cleanest" noise. I find other digital noise generators to be harsh or grating. Other generators also tend to loop in distracting ways. 

If you don't like using an iPhone app or a web browser to play the noise, you can [pay a dollar to download a 60-minute MP3][simplynoise].

**Pros:**

* Creates an intense sense of focus.

**Cons:**

* Difficult to use alongside music. The noise is quickly overwhelmed by the lyrics.
* Eventually drives you insane, like being locked in a hyperbaric chamber.

## Get Work Done Music

[Get Work Done Music][getworkdonemusic] streams fast-paced music from [SoundCloud][soundcloud]. The songs tend to be electronica/trance music, usually with pulsing rhythms.

**Pros:**

* Variety.
* You might actually discover artists that you like.

**Cons:**

* Depends on accurate SoundCloud tagging. Sometimes you get crazy demon-screaming garbage.

## Coffitivity

[Coffitivity][0080-002] is a site that plays coffee shop noises on a loop. This feels like a dumb idea. But when combined with music, it provides a pleasing mix of noise that is just enough to balance out your music's lyrics while still drowning out stray thoughts. 

If you don't like using a web browser to play sound, you can just [download the MP3][coffitivity].

**Pros:**

* You can play your own music.
* You don't feel like a total psychopath.

**Cons:**

* None: This is what I use most of the time.
