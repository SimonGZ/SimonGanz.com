description: "A look at Feedly, Feed Wrangler, and Feedbin as replacements for Google Reader."
---

Google recently [shut down Google Reader][2753-001], their RSS syncing service. Here's a quick look at three replacements:

## Feedly

[Feedly][2753-002] is the most popular Google Reader replacement because it's free and fast. But a few key problems prevented me from choosing it.

Feedly has **a closed API**. I have custom scripts and hacks I use for my RSS, and they require an open API. 

Feedly also has **no clear business model**. Free is great, but after Google Reader's epic flameout, it's hard to trust a service that doesn't ask for money. 

And finally, **Feedly's website and apps are over-designed and confusing**. Feedly seems desperate to become [Flipboard][2753-003], so their default layout is a magazine-style look at your RSS. You can switch to a "titles only" view that looks more like Google Reader, but you still have to deal with bizarre gestures and interactions in their iOS apps.

Despite these criticisms, Feedly is a strong service. If they open up their API, I'll consider switching to them and just using third-party apps to access the service.

## Feed Wrangler

[Feed Wrangler][2753-004] is a small, paid RSS syncing service created by iOS developer [David Smith][david-smith]. 

Several writers and programmers in the tech community sing the praises of this service, but I couldn't get over two things: **No free trial** and **an ugly, ugly, ugly website**.

## Feedbin

[Feedbin][2753-005] is a small, paid RSS syncing service created by Ruby on Rails developer [Ben Ubois][benubois]. It's **$30-a-year**, has an **attractive website**, and **an open API**.

## Winner: Feedbin

Feedbin is my new RSS reader. For now. The RSS market is changing fast, and I expect to revisit my choice a year from now when it's time to renew my subscription.
