I noticed some [sturm und drang online][reddit] about Texas Governor Rick Perry vetoing a bipartisan "Buy American" bill.[^buy] Interestingly, people angered by the bill include both liberal labor unions and nationalist conservatives. 

I think "Buy American" bills can lead to shoddy government. Supporting US manufacturing is a noble goal, but it shouldn't take hostage all other government responsibilities. If the federal government or a state or a city [wants to build a train system][lametro], for instance, they should focus on hiring vendors who will do the best possible job building a train system. Many of those vendors will be American and will generate jobs in the US, but the point of building the train should be to improve transportation, not to create those jobs.

Adding rules like "Buy American" encourages every government project to focus on local cronyism, rather than building whatever the hell they're supposed to build.

  [^buy]: Texas already has a "Buy American" bill. This bill just added more types of goods.
