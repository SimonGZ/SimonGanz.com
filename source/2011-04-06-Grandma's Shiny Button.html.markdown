# Update:

The button worked well for a year until a much better solution presented itself.  SiriusXM now offers [a special internet radio channel that automatically tunes to Mets games][MetsRadio].  That means Grandma can use the internet radio preset to listen to games.

I've since repurposed the PowerMate button so control iTunes and play/pause audio books for Grandma.
