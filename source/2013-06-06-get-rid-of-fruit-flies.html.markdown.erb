Fruit flies are tiny insects that lay their eggs on the skin of ripe or fermenting fruit. They're harmless, but you'll occasionally find a batch of them swirling around your kitchen.

Here's an easy way to get rid of them:

1. Take a wine glass.
2. Pour in some apple cider vinegar.
3. Put in a couple drops of dishwashing liquid.

The flies are attracted to the vinegar, but the curved glass and the dishwashing soap make it impossible for them to land on the surface, so they fall through and drown.

There are other [elaborate traps](http://insects.about.com/od/insectssociety/qt/Make-A-Vinegar-Trap-For-Fruit-Flies.htm) you can make (and obviously you should clean your kitchen as well), but the simple trap works very well.
