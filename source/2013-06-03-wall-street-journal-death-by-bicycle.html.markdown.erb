The Wall Street Journal has done the world a great service by posting [a video interview with one of their editorial board members][wsj]. In five excruciating minutes, Dorothy Rabinowitz demonstrates that the Journal's editorials are written by elderly cranks who think New York's bike-share program is akin to Stalin's Five Year Plan.

What I love about this interview is that you could have a more articulate discussion about bike-sharing with any random person on the street. Despite being an editorial board member for a prestigious national paper, she brings no factual knowledge or experience to bear. She makes repeated ad hominem attacks, and she relies entirely on anecdotal evidence gathered from her isolated life as a very wealthy woman living in New York. 

This is your crazy Aunt or Uncle being given the ear of 2.4 million subscribers.
