I've written [a Chrome Extension to show Walkscore results on Redfin][chrome-webstore].

## Background

[Walkscore.com][walkscore] uses Google Maps to calculate how walkable, bikeable, and transit-friendly a house or apartment is. [Redfin.com][redfin] is a real estate site that lists houses and condos for sale. If you're house hunting, you spend a lot of time bouncing back and forth between these two sites.

The extension also supports [TheMLS.com][MLS], a site that real estate agents use to email listings to their clients.

## How to Use It

While browsing Redfin.com, clicking on the extension (or using the keyboard shortcut Alt+W on the Mac) pops up a small window displaying the Walkscore.com page for that house.

## How to Install

You can install the extension [directly from the Chrome Webstore][chrome-webstore].
