[Fountain Loader](http://fountainloader.com "Fountain Loader") is an online previewer for [Fountain screenplay documents][9636-001]. It works with Google Driveâ„¢, making it easier to write screenplays in Google Docs.

## Why did I make this

Google Docs is the best collaborative writing program I've found. It lets me and my writing partner work on a script simultaneously, sometimes even working on the same sentence at the same time. 

But Google Docs is butt ugly. It doesn't even have a decent Courier font.[^font] I'm used to writing code and staring at ugly markup, but my writing partner can't stand it. Google Docs just doesn't look like a screenplay to him.

Fountain Loader bridges the visual gap between Google Docs and the final script. It loads our script as we work on it and generates a preview in another tab. It can also watch the file and update as the document changes.[^caveat]

## Features

- **Pretty damn accurate:** The preview should be very close to how your script will look when output by [John August's Highland app](http://quoteunquoteapps.com/highland/ "Highland - Quote-Unquote Apps").
- **Responsive:** Multiple layouts so you can preview screenplays on your phone or tablet.
- **Detect Changes mode:** Watches your document and generates new previews with each change.
- **Safe:** Fountain Loader renders everything locally in Javascript. Your screenplay goes directly from Google Drive to your browser without being saved on a server somewhere.

## Possible Future Features

- Use Fountain outlining elements to create fast-links to jump through a script (e.g. jump to act two).
- Toggle to hide notes and outline elements.

[^font]: I Use [cousine](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Cousine "Google Fonts Cousine"), a coding font that has the same metrics as Courier.
[^caveat]: Caveat: This feature depends on [Google Drive's change feed system](https://developers.google.com/drive/web/manage-changes), which doesn't update as fast as you might guess. It groups changes together and only updates every few minutes.
