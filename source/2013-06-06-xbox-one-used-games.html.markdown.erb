Kotaku has [a cynical rundown](http://kotaku.com/the-xbox-one-just-had-a-very-bad-day-511766497) of how Xbox One will handle used games. Basically, [my fears](http://simonganz.com/2013/05/pa-report-xbox-one-will-kill-used-games/) are confirmed:

> The Xbox One will allow the sale of used games, at "participating retailers", but only if the publisher allows it. Publishers being the very people opposed most fiercely to used video game sales.

Microsoft understands that this change is going to piss off a lot of people, so they're trying to pull a Pontius Pilate and offload the final decision onto the publishers. "Oh we really wish you could still buy and sell used games, but we left it as an option for the publishers, and those gosh darn meanies didn't implement it!"
