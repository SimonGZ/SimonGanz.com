I've released a small update to [Ranndy.com](http://ranndy.com "Ranndy Random Name Generator"), my random name generator site. Now every first and last name generated by the site contains a link to a Google search about that name.

For example, if I generate the surname "Swisher" and want to know more about it, I can click on the name and quickly learn that the name is Austrian and originally meant “person who lives near a hill, stream, or church.”

Sometimes when creating characters, I like to find last names that have hidden meanings and reflect the character’s personality.
