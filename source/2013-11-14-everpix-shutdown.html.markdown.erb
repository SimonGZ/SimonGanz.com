Sadly, [Everpix has announced that they are shutting down](https://support.everpix.com/entries/22586374 "Everpix Shutdown FAQ") and refunding their customers' money. I've added an update to the end of [my previous review](http://simonganz.com/2013/08/everpix-review/ "Everpix Review").

I have become addicted to the easy photo sharing and storage that Everpix offered, and I may take a look to see if Flickr or anyone else have gotten their act together and can act as a reasonable replacement.
