On October 19th, 2013, Anna and I attended THE YEEZUS TOUR. The headliner was Kanye West and the opener was Kendrick Lamar.

Kanye wore a freaky gimp mask:

{:/}

The Beyonce concert had thousands of swirling lights. Kanye preferred a single spotlight, focused on his favorite subject:

Kanye was an energetic, if not particularly skilled dancer:

But all that dancing made Kanye tired, so he took a break on top of these naked ladies:

{:/}

Instead of costume changes, Kanye had mask changes:

<img src="<%= image_path 'kanye_gifs/sparkle_face.gif' %>" title="Sparkling gimp mask" />
{:/}

Eventually he took the mask off:

{:/}

And then his mountain erupted and exploded:
