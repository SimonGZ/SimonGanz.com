Apple makes [their developer libraries][apple] freely available online with one important exception: Prerelease libraries can only be accessed by registered developers.

Why would a non-developer want to read these? Well if you're like me, you might be tech-savvy and curious about iOS 7 or Mavericks but not want to spend $99 to become a registered developer. Luckily there's an easy solution.

## Become a Safari Developer

Simply sign up to become [a Safari extensions developer][apple 2]. It's a free program that carries some of the same benefits as a paid iOS or Mac developer membership. 

Simply by providing your address and an Apple ID, you gain the ability to read prerelease developer documents and [learn details][simonganz] about Apple software months before it's released.
