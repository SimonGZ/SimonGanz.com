> Dr. Gay Hitler, son of George Washington Hitler, was a local dentist, serving our community from 1922 through 1946 from his office on West Main Street.

[Jonathan Chait](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/07/life-in-ohio-a-continuing-series.html "Life in Ohio: A Continuing Series") highlights [a great local newspaper story](http://www.circlevilletoday.com/news/hitlers-were-county-pioneers/article_2a6487b2-a34a-55f4-83f4-dfcf116d15d5.html "Hitlers were county pioneers") about the pioneering Hitler family of Pickaway, Ohio. A significant portion of the town is named after these honest, All-American, salt-of-the-earth Hitlers, and the townsfolk are tired of everyone thinking they're fans of the *slightly* more famous Adolf Hitler.
