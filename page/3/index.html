          <p>One interesting <a title="Kevin Drum: Supreme Court Prop 8 Ruling Problem" href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/06/supreme-court-prop-8-ruling-problem">side note</a> to today’s Supreme Court decision regarding Proposition 8:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Court’s reasoning does not take into account the fundamental principles or the practical dynamics of the initiative system in California, which uses this mechanism to control and to bypass public officials—the same officials who would not defend the initiative, an injury the Court now leaves unremedied. The Court’s decision also has implications for the 26 other States that use an initiative or popular referendum system and which, like California, may choose to have initiative proponents stand in for the State when public officials decline to defend an initiative in litigation.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>By finding that the proponents of a ballot measure have no standing to sue in federal court, the majority has set up a system in which California and other states can roll back voter initiatives they disagree with by simply refusing to defend them in federal court.</p>
          
          <p>This is undemocratic and strange, but I have to admit it doesn’t bother me much because…</p>
          
          <h2 id="the-initiative-system-sucks">The Initiative System Sucks</h2>
          
          <p>The initiative process in California is fundamentally broken. Rather than encouraging democracy, it undermines it by diffusing authority for basic decisionmaking in the state. No politician in California is ever responsible for anything because everything is subject to referendum. Voters elect politicians who cannot change how money is spent or raised or how crimes are punished. Then we all complain that nothing gets done in Sacramento.</p>
          
          <p>Worse, the initiative process distills every complex issue into a binary choice: Yes or no with no potential for compromise or revision.</p>
          
          <p>True, sometimes the system does good work. It offers chances for reform on issues like drugs or political redistricting that would probably die in the capitol. But more often it works as a system for millionaires and corporations to foist their personal agendas on California. <a title="Prop 15 Bans Cable Television" href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_15,_No_Fees_for_Television_Programs_Transmitted_to_Home_Televisions_(1964)">A 1960s proposition sponsored by theater owners banned cable television in the entire state</a>, and Proposition 13 famously destroyed local politics in California by capping property taxes.</p>
          
          <p>The initiative process has become less odious in recent years (Prop 8 excepted) simply because liberals have gotten better and better at abusing it the way conservatives did thirty years ago. Despite that, I’m glad that the Supreme Court inadvertently smashed up the intiative system in their zeal to avoid deciding on gay marriage directly.</p>

          <p>I previously voiced <a title="Xbox One Will Kill Used Games" href="http://simonganz.com/2013/05/pa-report-xbox-one-will-kill-used-games/">my displeasure with Microsoft’s planned console DRM scheme</a>. In short, it had more restrictions than digital distribution systems like <a title="Welcome to Steam" href="http://steampowered.com/">Steam</a> or iOS while offering few of the benefits.</p>
          
          <p>I wasn’t the only person annoyed. Sony drew blood with <a title="PS4: How to Share Used Games" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vfjdaU3lkA">vicious and biting videos</a> at Microsoft’s expense, and even <a title="Xbox One Has Singlehandedly Alienated the Military" href="http://www.navytimes.com/article/20130614/OFFDUTY02/306140030">US military publications spoke out against the system</a>. Microsoft tried to stanch the bleeding, promising that you could share your game with ten friends and log in your console from your phone and etc etc, but these were complicated digital solutions to problems that don’t exist with current generation consoles.</p>
          
          <p>It’s not a huge surprise then that Microsoft has folded their hand and <a title="Xbox One Policy Change Update" href="http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/update">given up on the whole scheme</a>.</p>
          
          <p>This was an unforced error by Microsoft. They designed the new system around their own corporate needs and only belatedly considered how the changes would affect real users. They never made an affirmative case for why this system would be better than the status quo. They just tried to muscle it through. I think the final straw for Microsoft was realizing that none of the major publishers, the very companies this system would most benefit, publicly backed Microsoft’s position during the controversy.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>And so when we look at the stories in Abrams’ work we don’t find much in the way of story at all. We find plots. It’s all master secretive plans built on reveals upon reveals upon reveals. We watch as brilliant characters play a high-stakes game of trying to outsmart each other. We watch those plans get teased out in incomprehensible ways. We watch them unravel a story without a hint of organic discovery.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p><em>Lost</em> fans should be shaking their heads in recognition right now.</p>
          
          <p>Hulk’s post clarifies a lesson I’ve been trying to learn. <strong>Screenplay is a way to tell a story, but it is not the story itself.</strong></p>
          
          <p>Story is something underneath the screenplay. It’s what the dialogue, action, plot, and pacing of the screenplay are trying to convey.</p>
          
          <p>Without a story, a screenplay is just empty mechanics. It’s hollow and unfulfilling. In short, it’s <a title="Transformers 2" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1055369/">Transformers 2</a>.</p>

          <p>I am so glad to hear that <a title="iCloud Keychain" href="http://www.apple.com/osx/preview/#icloud-keychain">Apple is adding a password auto-generator</a> to future versions of Safari on Mac and iOS.</p>
          
          <p>As someone who has worked tech support as a personal assistant (and for my parents), I can tell you that people use terrible passwords. They pick a common word, maybe slap a number on the end, and then use that same password for everything.</p>
          
          <p>Normal people don’t realize <a title="How Crackers Make Minced Meat out of Your Passwords" href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/">how easy it is to crack even the most eXtR3m3!! passwords</a>.</p>
          
          <p>I use <a title="1Password - AgileBits" href="http://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> to generate random unique passwords for every online account, and I’ve tried to set that system up for other people too. But it’s fiddly and complicated. It requires a browser extension, and it requires the user to remember to actually use the damn thing.</p>
          
          <p>Apple’s solution will not be the best password solution, but just as they did with personal backups and Time Machine, they’re taking something complicated and vital and distilling it down to something simple enough for my mom to use. </p>
          
          <p>I think this will be a huge security improvement for average users.</p>

          </blockquote>
          
          <p>I don’t like <a title="Why Google Reader Got the Axe" href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/06/why-google-reader-got-the-ax/">Google’s explanation for killing Google Reader</a>.</p>
          
          <p>Yes, Twitter and social media have changed how we consume news and internet posts. But the niche Google Reader and <a title="RSS - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> serve is not about “leisurely” browsing of the internet over eggs and bacon.</p>
          
          <p>By checking my RSS feed, I can skim and select from hundreds of stories from my favorite sites and authors in less than a minute.<sup id="fnref:small"><a href="#fn:small" class="footnote">1</a></sup> </p>
          
          <p>In contrast, Twitter and Facebook give me a random shotgun blast full of memes, links, and advertisements. I do not want to like or follow every public figure, author, or company that interests me and then have those people shit up my social feed. My social feed is just that, social. It shows me what <em>other</em> people think I should be reading, which is not always what <em>I</em> want to read.</p>
          
          <p>I understand that RSS has always been a niche technology and that Google is probably making the right choice by focusing their efforts on more casual users. But I think Wired hits on a darker, potentially more accurate explanation for the change:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>Now and Plus do one thing: They keep you in Google’s world. It’s a de-emphasis of content source. In other words, rather than reading Cat Fancy religiously, you’re reading the Animals category religiously — a category populated by the sites Google’s products think you’ll enjoy most.</p>

          <p>Kotaku has <a href="http://kotaku.com/the-xbox-one-just-had-a-very-bad-day-511766497">a cynical rundown</a> of how Xbox One will handle used games. Basically, <a href="http://simonganz.com/2013/05/pa-report-xbox-one-will-kill-used-games/">my fears</a> are confirmed:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Xbox One will allow the sale of used games, at “participating retailers”, but only if the publisher allows it. Publishers being the very people opposed most fiercely to used video game sales.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Microsoft understands that this change is going to piss off a lot of people, so they’re trying to pull a Pontius Pilate and offload the final decision onto the publishers. “Oh we really wish you could still buy and sell used games, but we left it as an option for the publishers, and those gosh darn meanies didn’t implement it!”</p>

          <p>Fruit flies are tiny insects that lay their eggs on the skin of ripe or fermenting fruit. They’re harmless, but you’ll occasionally find a batch of them swirling around your kitchen.</p>
          
          <p>Here’s an easy way to get rid of them:</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li>Take a wine glass.</li>
            <li>Pour in some apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>Put in a couple drops of dishwashing liquid.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>The flies are attracted to the vinegar, but the curved glass and the dishwashing soap make it impossible for them to land on the surface, so they fall through and drown.</p>
          
          <p>There are other <a href="http://insects.about.com/od/insectssociety/qt/Make-A-Vinegar-Trap-For-Fruit-Flies.htm">elaborate traps</a> you can make (and obviously you should clean your kitchen as well), but the simple trap works very well. </p>

          <p>The Wall Street Journal has done the world a great service by posting <a title="WSJ: Death By Bicycle" href="http://on.wsj.com/19tHx3t">a video interview with one of their editorial board members</a>. In five excruciating minutes, Dorothy Rabinowitz demonstrates that the Journal’s editorials are written by elderly cranks who think New York’s bike-share program is akin to Stalin’s Five Year Plan.</p>
          
          <p>What I love about this interview is that you could have a more articulate discussion about bike-sharing with any random person on the street. Despite being an editorial board member for a prestigious national paper, she brings no factual knowledge or experience to bear. She makes repeated ad hominem attacks, and she relies entirely on anecdotal evidence gathered from her isolated life as a very wealthy woman living in New York. </p>
          
          <p>This is your crazy Aunt or Uncle being given the ear of 2.4 million subscribers.</p>

            <p>At the time, though, this was disconcertingly radical, it didn’t respect conventional norms. There was a black woman who wasn’t a cook or maid; there was a Russian (the Enemy of the current Cold War), and a Japanese (an Enemy from a previous war). Sulu and Chekov looked like the Bad Guys – but they weren’t. Spock, too, looked weird, alien, almost devilish – as though he, too, was supposed to be a Bad Guy.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>From here, the author veers into goofy fanfiction, recasting and gender swapping the parts in JJ Abrams’ Star Trek in ways that would be as radical to modern audiences as the Original Series cast was to 1960s audiences. In the fantasy cast, there are no white males, and supreme effort is taken to have ethnically appropriate actors for every role (rather than fudging English for Scottish, this Asian for that Asian, etc).</p>
          
          <p>The author’s approach is too nerdy even for me and gives zero deference to the financial realities of Hollywood filmmaking. But there’s an interesting point here. </p>
          
          <p>Star Trek is about the future. But more specifically, Star Trek is about a radically utopian and progressive future that goes much deeper than transporters and warp drives. Recreating the relationships and stories from the original cast is fun and makes for entertaining films. But it also turns the franchise into something harmless. It makes the whole thing retro rather than radical. And something important is lost in the process. </p>
