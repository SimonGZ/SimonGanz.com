&lt;p&gt;I did not like Man of Steel. If you want to know why, I recommend two posts about the film: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rob Bricken's &lt;a href="http://io9.com/the-most-important-scenes-from-man-of-steel-as-i-remem-516405346" title="The Most Important Scenes from Man of Steel as I remember Them"&gt;hilarious Man of Steel recap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Film Crit Hulk's &lt;a href="http://badassdigest.com/2013/07/03/film-crit-hulk-man-of-steel/" title="The Importance of Dramatizing Character"&gt;lengthy, rambling, and totally spot on review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id="fnref:dehulkifier"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:dehulkifier" class="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do want to touch on one idea that I haven't seen explored much in reviews of the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="good-action-requires-consequences-and-character"&gt;Good Action Requires Consequences and Character&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common defense of Man of Steel is that it has "good action." The movie has &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; special effects sequences, featuring superpowered fist fights, flying dragon-butterfly monsters, laser eye-battles, etc… In short, superhero battles on a level never before attempted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all of that action is boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man of Steel lacks original or inventive ideas for its superhero fight scenes. Characters line up and punch and hit each other through building after building. "Pow! Superman crashes into a bank vault!" "Blammo! Zod plows through a gas station!" The spectacle entertains for about fifteen minutes, but the movie never finds a second gear. Superman and Zod are invulnerable. There are no consequences to each punch or each moment in any particular fight scene. Perhaps sensing this problem, the movie tries to blow up bigger and bigger buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action scenes also lack character. We rarely understand the personal stakes in each fight. Superman has an elaborate brawl with three Kryptonians that destroys his home town of Smallville and at the end… &lt;em&gt;Nothing&lt;/em&gt;. The villains just fly away because they got tired of fighting. That's because there is nothing at stake in the scene for them. The characters simply fight to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's so sad about this is that fun goofy action shouldn't require you to turn your brain off or ignore the story. Just look at the batpod sequence in &lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="video-container"&gt;
  &lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FPaTv98wUsE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Dark Knight&lt;/em&gt; batpod sequence is much, much smaller than even the opening action scenes in Man of Steel, but it feels grounded and visceral. Harvey Dent, a character we've spent significant time with, is in mortal peril after bravely standing up to the Joker by claiming that he is Batman. If the Joker kills Harvey, the city will be thrown into further panic and chaos. Also in the audience's mind: Harvey and Batman are competing for the same woman, Rachel, so Batman saving Harvey will have significant personal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But forget all that character shit. Isn't this sequence fucking fun!? Batman reveals his batmobile can turn into a crazy sideways motorcycle, races across Gotham, drives through a mall, plays chicken with a semi-truck, swoops under the truck, flips the truck AT-AT style, then drives up a wall to turn around? HOLY SHIT THAT WAS COOL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I defy anyone to find one sequence in Man of Steel even half as unexpected and entertaining as this &lt;em&gt;Dark Knight&lt;/em&gt; sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;You can read Hulk's article using my &lt;a href="http://simonganz.com/2013/04/the-dehulkifier/" title="The Dehulkifier"&gt;DeHulkifier bookmarklet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="#fnref:dehulkifier" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mac OS X Stuck Registering Updated Components</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently tried to run software update on my dad's aging Macbook Pro (Snow Leopard, Unibody). Unfortunately, the process stalled during "Registering Updated Components", leaving the computer stuck in the install for 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's how I fixed it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once you're sure the install is stuck, hold down the power button to forcibly shut down the computer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restart the computer and open Finder.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Type ⇧⌘G to bring up the "Go To Folder…" dialogue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Type /Library/Updates and hit enter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delete everything in the Updates folder.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run Software Update again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, the security update dad's computer was trying to install was somehow corrupted. Redownloading it generated a fresh copy. I hope this is helpful to someone out there with the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apple makes &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/" title="Apple Developer Program"&gt;their developer libraries&lt;/a&gt; freely available online with one important exception: Prerelease libraries can only be accessed by registered developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would a non-developer want to read these? Well if you're like me, you might be tech-savvy and curious about iOS 7 or Mavericks but not want to spend $99 to become a registered developer. Luckily there's an easy solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="become-a-safari-developer"&gt;Become a Safari Developer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply sign up to become &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/safari/" title="Safari Developer Program"&gt;a Safari extensions developer&lt;/a&gt;. It's a free program that carries some of the same benefits as a paid iOS or Mac developer membership. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply by providing your address and an Apple ID, you gain the ability to read prerelease developer documents and &lt;a href="http://simonganz.com/2013/06/rounded-rectangles-deprecated/" title="Rounded Rectangles Deprecated"&gt;learn details&lt;/a&gt; about Apple software months before it's released.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was reading through the pre-release documentation for iOS 7 and came across this gem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The rounded rectangle button has been deprecated in iOS 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this amusing? Because &lt;a href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Round_Rects_Are_Everywhere.txt" title="Round Rects Are Everywhere"&gt;rounded rectangles were one of the big user interface innovations of the Macintosh&lt;/a&gt; and were demanded by Steve Jobs himself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Steve suddenly got more intense. "Rectangles with rounded corners are everywhere! Just look around this room!". And sure enough, there were lots of them, like the whiteboard and some of the desks and tables. Then he pointed out the window. "And look outside, there's even more, practically everywhere you look!". He even persuaded Bill to take a quick walk around the block with him, pointing out every rectangle with rounded corners that he could find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly every button on the Mac and on iOS has been a rounded rectangle for the past thirty years. So there's something charmingly radical about a modern day Apple engineer calmly stating that they've been discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to Add Incredibly Powerful Emacs-style Shortcuts to Mac OS X</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="/2013/06/add-emacs-key-bindings-to-mac-os-x/"/>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id="what-is-emacs"&gt;What is Emacs?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" title="GNU Emacs"&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; is a very nerdy text editor/email program/development suite/nuclear reactor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's ugly and weird and hard to use because it dates back to a time before computers had mice. But for that same reason, it has amazing tools and shortcuts for rapidly editing and moving through text with only your keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mac OS X has always had some of &lt;a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/Site/System%20Bindings.html" title="Mac OS X Default Key Bindings"&gt;these shortcuts baked in&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, type &lt;em&gt;Ctrl+e&lt;/em&gt; in an OS X text field and the cursor will jump to the end of a line. Type &lt;em&gt;Ctrl+k&lt;/em&gt; and everything between the cursor and the end of the line will be deleted (this is crazy useful when editing; I suggest trying it out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned these shortcuts for convenience sake a few years back, but recently the trackpad on my Macbook Pro died and I was forced to turn to them full time.&lt;sup id="fnref:magic"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:magic" class="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The problem is that by default, OS X only allows you to use a few select Emacs shortcuts that utilize the ctrl key. Many other powerful Emacs shortcuts are unavailable (including every shortcut that uses the alt key, referred to as the "meta" key in Emacs lingo).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can change this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="changing-mac-os-x-key-bindings"&gt;Changing Mac OS X Key Bindings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These directions are adapted from &lt;a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/site/cocoa-text.html" title="Customizing the Cocoa Text System"&gt;this excellent 2006 article by Jacob Rus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2011/08/13/keybinding-madness/" title="Keybinding Madness"&gt;this excellent 2011 post by Brett Terpstra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a folder named "KeyBindings" in the ~/Library directory.&lt;sup id="fnref:library"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:library" class="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download &lt;a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/KeyBindings/zipball/master" title="Brett Terpstra Killer Keybindings"&gt;this DefaultKeyBinding.dict zip file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unzip the files and place the DefaultKeyBinding.dict file into the newly created KeyBindings folder. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as soon as you restart any running apps, you'll have access to an &lt;a href="http://ttscoff.github.io/KeyBindings/" title="Brett Terpstra Killer Keybindings"&gt;insanely powerful list of keyboard shortcuts&lt;/a&gt; in almost every Mac OS X application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do crazy powerful things like uppercase words with &lt;em&gt;Ctrl+U&lt;/em&gt; or copy entire paragraphs instantly by typing &lt;em&gt;Alt+y&lt;/em&gt;. You can move paragraphs using only your keyboard (&lt;em&gt;Ctrl+Command+K&lt;/em&gt;) or delete trailing whitespaces off a line (&lt;em&gt;Ctrl+Alt+Right Arrow&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These key bindings will be overkill for most people, and they may even break a few shortcuts on your computer, but the possibilities are incredible. You can even customize them yourself by editing the DefaultKeyBinding.dict file in a text editor, adding to or tweaking the shortcuts to fit your own workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you spend a lot of time typing text or coding on Mac OS X, you owe it to yourself to play around with a few of these shortcuts and see how they can speed up your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class="footnotes"&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:magic"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I eventually bought a &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/magictrackpad/" title="Apple - Magic Trackpad - Multi-Touch trackpad for your desktop."&gt;Magic Trackpad&lt;/a&gt; as a replacement.&lt;a href="#fnref:magic" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:library"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;By default, the User's library folder is hidden in Mac OS X. You can access it by opening Finder, selecting the Go menu from the menubar, and holding down the alt key to make the Library option appear.&lt;a href="#fnref:library" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>→ Overturning Prop 8 Affects Future California Initiatives [link]</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One interesting &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/06/supreme-court-prop-8-ruling-problem" title="Kevin Drum: Supreme Court Prop 8 Ruling Problem"&gt;side note&lt;/a&gt; to today's Supreme Court decision regarding Proposition 8:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Court's reasoning does not take into account the fundamental principles or the practical dynamics of the initiative system in California, which uses this mechanism to control and to bypass public officials—the same officials who would not defend the initiative, an injury the Court now leaves unremedied. The Court's decision also has implications for the 26 other States that use an initiative or popular referendum system and which, like California, may choose to have initiative proponents stand in for the State when public officials decline to defend an initiative in litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By finding that the proponents of a ballot measure have no standing to sue in federal court, the majority has set up a system in which California and other states can roll back voter initiatives they disagree with by simply refusing to defend them in federal court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is undemocratic and strange, but I have to admit it doesn't bother me much because…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-initiative-system-sucks"&gt;The Initiative System Sucks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiative process in California is fundamentally broken. Rather than encouraging democracy, it undermines it by diffusing authority for basic decisionmaking in the state. No politician in California is ever responsible for anything because everything is subject to referendum. Voters elect politicians who cannot change how money is spent or raised or how crimes are punished. Then we all complain that nothing gets done in Sacramento.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse, the initiative process distills every complex issue into a binary choice: Yes or no with no potential for compromise or revision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True, sometimes the system does good work. It offers chances for reform on issues like drugs or political redistricting that would probably die in the capitol. But more often it works as a system for millionaires and corporations to foist their personal agendas on California. &lt;a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_15,_No_Fees_for_Television_Programs_Transmitted_to_Home_Televisions_(1964)" title="Prop 15 Bans Cable Television"&gt;A 1960s proposition sponsored by theater owners banned cable television in the entire state&lt;/a&gt;, and Proposition 13 famously destroyed local politics in California by capping property taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiative process has become less odious in recent years (Prop 8 excepted) simply because liberals have gotten better and better at abusing it the way conservatives did thirty years ago. Despite that, I'm glad that the Supreme Court inadvertently smashed up the intiative system in their zeal to avoid deciding on gay marriage directly.&lt;/p&gt;
