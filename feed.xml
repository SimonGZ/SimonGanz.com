  &lt;p&gt;"Gov. Perry by his veto has undercut the creation and preservation of manufacturing jobs in Texas and the U.S." Texas AFL-CIO President Becky Moeller said. "These jobs are critical to our economic success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed some &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1fc3g7/rick_perry_vetoes_buy_american_bill_approved_1450/"&gt;sturm und drang online&lt;/a&gt; about Texas Governor Rick Perry vetoing a bipartisan "Buy American" bill.&lt;sup id="fnref:buy"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:buy" class="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Interestingly, people angered by the bill include both liberal labor unions and nationalist conservatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think "Buy American" bills can lead to shoddy government. Supporting US manufacturing is a noble goal, but it shouldn't take hostage all other government responsibilities. If the federal government or a state or a city &lt;a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/24/local/la-me-0524-rail-cars-20120524"&gt;wants to build a train system&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, they should focus on hiring vendors who will do the best possible job building a train system. Many of those vendors will be American and will generate jobs in the US, but the point of building the train should be to improve transportation, not to create those jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding rules like "Buy American" encourages every government project to focus on local cronyism, rather than building whatever the hell they're supposed to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class="footnotes"&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:buy"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Texas already has a "Buy American" bill. This bill just added more types of goods.&lt;a href="#fnref:buy" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Under our antiquated electoral system his government enjoyed virtual dictatorial powers winning 64 per cent of the seats in the legislature with only 45 per cent of the popular vote – most of this support concentrated in the right-leaning suburbs. He didn't need to represent the province, just his political base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gawker.com/for-sale-a-video-of-toronto-mayor-rob-ford-smoking-cra-507736569"&gt;Toronto Mayor Rob Ford smokes crack.&lt;/a&gt; Allegedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every story of incompetent governance or corruption in politics is really a story about bad political institutions. In this case, an outdated electoral system that favors suburban and rural voters over urban voters has led to cosmopolitan Toronto being ruled by a series of right-wing suburban mayors, ill-equipped to run a major city. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political institutions are boring and almost no effort is spent campaigning for their reform. Often that's because the institutions favor one party over another. But how we vote, what bodies we vote for, and how the votes are counted are actually much more important forces than individual candidates and campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why the most populous city in Canada has a drug smoking racist for a mayor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Conversation Tip for Weirdos</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am not a social person and do not especially enjoy social events. For years in college, I would repeatedly say the wrong thing to people, horribly offending them with no idea how or why it had happened. My friends would then laugh and remark how I'd "done it again."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have cobbled together one simple strategy that my fellow weirdos may find helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-to-talk-to-a-stranger"&gt;How to Talk to a Stranger&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask questions. Then ask more questions. Then keep asking questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"Oh, you work at X? What's that like? Uh huh. So what companies do you represent? Oh really. What are they like? Oh really? What type of software do you use for that? How did you get that job? Oh you used to work at Y? What was that like? What's the craziest Z you've seen?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds stupid. In fact, it's basically the way &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatterbot" title="Wikipedia - Chatterbot"&gt;computer chatbots&lt;/a&gt; operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is remarkably effective. And it's not as creepy as it sounds. I've found that by asking many questions, I can eventually land on a topic that genuinely interests me and have a real conversation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's why it works. Everyone you meet is an expert in something. It may be something seemingly trivial, like mall security procedures&lt;sup id="fnref:actually"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:actually" class="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or class action lawsuits, but no one's made it 20+ years in life without learning a lot about something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can find that hidden expertise, you'll be amazed at the level of detail and character you can get out of someone about their job, their life, or their hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class="footnotes"&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:actually"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Actually I love expertise like that. I love it when someone knows everything there is to know about a topic to which I've applied zero thought.&lt;a href="#fnref:actually" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>→ PA Report: Xbox One Will Kill Used Games [link]</title>

  &lt;p&gt;Once that secondary market is removed you can suddenly profit from every copy of your game sold, and as profit margins rise it's possible we'll see prices drop. Some stodgy publishers will likely stay with the $60 model, but they're dead companies walking already. The smart companies will see this opportunity to play with pricing and see what works and what doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Kuchera at &lt;a href="http://penny-arcade.com/report" title="Penny-Arcade Report"&gt;Penny-Arcade&lt;/a&gt; has an optimistic take on Microsoft eliminating the used game market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd love to believe this, but I think the carrot and stick are out of whack here. If you're going to eliminate the ability for me to buy and sell used games, then you have to offer a reasonable tradeoff. "Oh, I can't resell my game anymore, but now my game is cheaper/downloadable/more convenient."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Microsoft is offering is a step backward from &lt;a href="http://www.steampowered.com/" title="Steampowered Games"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;. You still have to buy a physical disc, only now that disc is just an installer and your copy is linked to your $50-a-year Xbox Live account. But what if you lose the disc? Do you have to re-buy the physical disc? Can you just download it? And what happens in the future when Xbox Two comes out? Will my games still work/still be tied to my account?&lt;sup id="fnref:nope"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:nope" class="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of Microsoft's responses are about ways you can kind of, sort of approximate the convenience of the current setup with their new system, but they don't actually explain why their new system is better for me as a consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class="footnotes"&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:nope"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Probably not, since Microsoft has already said that Xbox Live Arcade purchases made on the 360 will not play on the Xbox One.&lt;a href="#fnref:nope" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in middle school, my brother and I used to record every episode of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Science_Theater_3000" title="Mystery Science Theater 3000 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"&gt;MST3K&lt;/a&gt; onto eight-hour VHS tapes. The show was on late and the jokes were fast, so we wanted to be able to watch them over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In high school, with the show cancelled, I felt certain that it was going to disappear and I'd never be able to see it again. So I started downloading the episodes from a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDonkey_network" title="eDonkey network - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"&gt;peer-to-peer network&lt;/a&gt;, with a 56kbps modem, and archiving them one by one on custom-labeled CD-Rs. My goal was to have the entire show stored for posterity. By college, the CD-Rs had degraded and the whole collection was worthless. I gave up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it's 2013, and I can dial up every single episode instantly  via YouTube whenever I want. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huh. Starting to realize I wasted &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wired.com has an exclusive look at the design of the new Xbox. More interesting to me though, is the web design of the Wired article itself. There are some clever presentational elements, including a scrolling effect which reveals an image of the new Xbox at the same moment you're reading the author's description of a Microsoft executive pulling a cloth cover off the prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually dislike attempts to make magazine articles into interactive websites, but this is an interactive element that compliments and enhances the actual content of the article, creating an experience you couldn't get in print.&lt;/p&gt;
