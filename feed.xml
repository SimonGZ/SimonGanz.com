&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.everpix.com/"&gt;Everpix&lt;/a&gt; is a subscription photo service that promises unlimited online storage and automatic organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short Review… &lt;strong&gt;It does the first part, storage and sync, perfectly. The second part is still a work in progress.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much Longer Review…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-life-and-death-of-iphoto"&gt;The Life and Death of iPhoto&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img src="/images/everpixIPhoto-f799e180.jpg" title="iPhoto" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to see what a perfect photo collection looks like, just visit an Apple store. On each display computer, you'll find a copy of iPhoto&lt;sup id="fnref:iPhoto"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:iPhoto" class="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, pre-set with Apple's idealized vision of a family photo library. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple's sample library is organized along every axis. Each image is tagged with Events, Albums, Faces, Keywords, Locations, and even a Five-Star Rating scale. Each sample album is an idyllic vacation or outing, populated exclusively by beautiful, multicultural families who never take bad photos and whose trips happen in confined locations, with no stranger's faces in the background. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the dream world of iPhoto, as well as its mission statement: &lt;strong&gt;All of your photos, organized&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But throw a real family with real photos at the program and it chokes on every word of that statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can't handle &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of your photos because there are too many of them and they're too big. You're taking 8-megapixel pictures and shooting 1080p video with your iPhone. And god forbid you shoot a &lt;a href="http://photo.net/learn/raw/"&gt;DSLR in RAW format&lt;/a&gt;. Suddenly that 128GB SSD hard-drive in your Macbook Air is full and you're rationing photos to save space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And once your photos are in iPhoto, they're no longer &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; photos. iPhoto buries them in its own convoluted file system. It only begrudgingly lets you share them using aging plug-ins to services like Facebook and Flickr.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And it's not &lt;strong&gt;organized&lt;/strong&gt; unless you obsessively do the work of tagging every photo yourself. I like to imagine that the fictional mom in Apple's sample iPhoto library is suffering from OCD. Are you coming to bed honey? "One minute! Just need to rate all the vacation photos on a 5-point scale!"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="everpix-fk-organizing"&gt;Everpix: F**k Organizing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of Everpix is simple: &lt;strong&gt;All of your photos.&lt;/strong&gt; That's it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everpix gives up on the idea that anyone is going to organize anything. The service is a giant, bottomless bucket into which you quickly and easily dump every photo you take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the service had a motto, it would be &lt;em&gt;"Upload Everything and Let God Sort It Out."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, Everpix &lt;a href="http://blog.everpix.com/post/40309088612/to-reclaim-your-photos-kill-the-algorithm" title="Kill the Algorithm"&gt;claims to organize your photos automatically&lt;/a&gt;, but this is happy talk. A fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re &lt;strong&gt;developing&lt;/strong&gt; image analysis technology that understands your photos and helps you manage your collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We're &lt;strong&gt;building&lt;/strong&gt; new ways for you to enjoy and rediscover your pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the present progressive tense ("-ing"). Automatic organization is something they're working on, but what's in the product right now is at best a proof of concept. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everpix hides duplicate photos, tries to guess which photos you're most interested in, and tries to categorize photos by broad categories like People, Nature, Food, etc. It doesn't do any of these things particularly well or accurately. &lt;em&gt;But that's okay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because what Everpix does do is great. &lt;strong&gt;Everpix syncs, stores, and displays decades of photos quickly and effortlessly&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install the Everpix app on your computer and your phone, and soon every photo you've ever taken is available everywhere. Despite the complete lack of organization, Everpix's approach has put me in touch with more old photos in a week than iPhoto did in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like this hilarious, random New York couple in 2004:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="/images/everpixNewYorkCouple-9748c8ba.jpg" title="The couple that reads together..." /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or my little brother-in-law’s smile in 2007:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="/images/everpixJoey-272398bf.jpg" title="Joey smiles" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn't seen either of these photos in years. Probably not since they were taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="alternatives"&gt;Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flickr&lt;/strong&gt; now offers one terabyte of free storage, but that number is more of a dare than reality. As in "I dare you to somehow manually upload one terabyte of photos when our service caps each upload session to 200 photos."&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt; is designed for sharing. It's great at that task, but it doesn't keep high quality copies of your photos and it's impossible to use the service without sharing everything.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt; has added some fantastic photo sharing and photo album features. But I have 70 gigs of photos going back a decade. At current prices, that means spending $100-a-year and eventually $200-a-year once I add another 30 gigs of photos.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iCloud Photostream&lt;/strong&gt; is barely a photo service. It's useful in that it quickly moves photos from one device to all of your devices, but it only stores your last 1000 photos and cannot be upgraded or relied upon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everpix is a solid service. They offer &lt;a href="http://evrpx.co/invite?r=simong%40gmail.com"&gt;18 months&lt;/a&gt; of photo storage for free and unlimited photo storage for $49-a-year. The website and iOS apps are barebones, but each is being &lt;a href="http://status.everpix.com"&gt;rapidly updated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having all of my photos backed up and instantly accessible is well worth the price of admission. Any other features they add over the next year are gravy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class="footnotes"&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:iPhoto"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;iPhoto 2011 to be exact. Apple hasn't updated it in years and it doesn't sync with its newer iOS counterparts at all. &lt;a href="#fnref:iPhoto" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Free space on &lt;a href="http://db.tt/DcIkRM3k"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; is worth its weight in gold. You get to keep it forever, and every additional megabyte postpones the day when you'll have to switch to their &lt;a href="http://www.dropbox.com/pricing"&gt;$100-a-year paid plan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, this week Dropbox is giving away free space if you try their iOS Gmail client, &lt;a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com/"&gt;Mailbox&lt;/a&gt; (also free). If you have an iOS device, &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mailbox/id576502633?mt=8"&gt;download the app&lt;/a&gt;, go to settings, and link it to your Dropbox account. You get the free gig of space immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Using Ambient Noise to Drown Out Distraction</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I struggle to work in silence. My mind gets crowded with ideas. But I also struggle to work with music. My mind begins to follow the lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambient noise is a way to drown out your thoughts without distracting your focus. Here are three tools I recommend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="simplynoise"&gt;SimplyNoise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://simplynoise.com/" title="SimplyNoise -- The Best Free White Noise Generator on the Internet."&gt;SimplyNoise&lt;/a&gt; is a site that plays &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise" title="Wikipedia: Colors of noise"&gt;white, pink, and brown noise&lt;/a&gt;. There are many sites and many apps that do this, but in my opinion, SimplyNoise has the "cleanest" noise. I find other digital noise generators to be harsh or grating. Other generators also tend to loop in distracting ways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't like using an iPhone app or a web browser to play the noise, you can &lt;a href="http://simplynoise.com/downloads.html" title="SimplyNoise downloads"&gt;pay a dollar to download a 60-minute MP3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creates an intense sense of focus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Difficult to use alongside music. The noise is quickly overwhelmed by the lyrics.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eventually drives you insane, like being locked in a hyperbaric chamber.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="get-work-done-music"&gt;Get Work Done Music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.getworkdonemusic.com/" title="Get Work Done Music"&gt;Get Work Done Music&lt;/a&gt; streams fast-paced music from &lt;a href="http://soundcloud.com/" title="SoundCloud - Share Your Sounds"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;. The songs tend to be electronica/trance music, usually with pulsing rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Variety.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You might actually discover artists that you like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Depends on accurate SoundCloud tagging. Sometimes you get crazy demon-screaming garbage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="coffitivity"&gt;Coffitivity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://coffitivity.com/" title="Coffitivity - Increase Your Creativity!"&gt;Coffitivity&lt;/a&gt; is a site that plays coffee shop noises on a loop. This feels like a dumb idea. But when combined with music, it provides a pleasing mix of noise that is just enough to balance out your music's lyrics while still drowning out stray thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't like using a web browser to play sound, you can just &lt;a href="http://coffitivity.com/other/cleanupcut.mp3" title="Coffitivity MP3 File"&gt;download the MP3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can play your own music.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don't feel like a total psychopath.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None: This is what I use most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>→ Paul Offit and the Vitamin Myth [link]</title>

  &lt;p&gt;Seven previous studies had already shown that vitamins increased the risk of cancer and heart disease and shortened lives. Still, in 2012, more than half of all Americans took some form of vitamin supplements. What few people realize, however, is that their fascination with vitamins can be traced back to one man. A man who was so spectacularly right that he won two Nobel Prizes and so spectacularly wrong that he was arguably the world's greatest quack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ouch&lt;/em&gt;. The Atlantic has &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/07/the-vitamin-myth-why-we-think-we-need-supplements/277947/" title="The Vitamin Myth: Why We Think We Need Supplements"&gt;a brutal book excerpt&lt;/a&gt; from Dr. Paul Offit tearing into the vitamin supplement industry. This is the same Dr. Offit who attacked the fake link between vaccines and autism in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/023114637X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=023114637X&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=simongcom-20" title="Autism's False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure"&gt;an earlier book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've always treated vitamins like a reassuring and benign superstition. "I don't feel well, I guess I'll take some vitamins!" "I could use a pick-me-up, I'll drink some Emergen-C!" "My penis isn't long enough, I'll inject some Ostrich estrus!" (Okay not the last one.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offit's article really shocked me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="rebuttals"&gt;Rebuttals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has of course been pushback. Dr. Paul Jaminet, an astrophysicist who writes diet books, has &lt;a href="http://perfecthealthdiet.com/2013/07/the-case-of-the-killer-vitamins-revisited/" title="The Case of the Killer Vitamins Revisited"&gt;a measured response&lt;/a&gt;. He takes issue with the specific studies cited by Offit, in particular an Iowa study which suggested that vitamins increase mortality (ie make you more likely to die) did not adjust for age. It compared older people who were taking supplements with younger people who were not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most compelling criticism is that the book excerpt blurs the line between taking a simple multivitamin and overdosing on Vitamin C because you think it'll help you shoot lasers from your eyes. In &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/26/vitamins-health-paul-offit-qanda" title="Vitamins: Should You Stop Taking THem"&gt;an online interview with The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, Offit explains the distinction in less sensationlist terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Other people think: “Because I'm not sure I'm getting all my vitamins, let me just take take a multivitamin every day” – which is OK. Multivitamins contain at or about the recommended dose of vitamins for that day. But then there are some people who believe that more is better – that by taking large quantities of daily vitamins they will do even better, live even longer and decrease the risk of cancer or heart disease. But in fact, many studies have shown that the exact opposite is true – that if you choose to take these large quantities of excess vitamins, then you increase risk of cancer and heart disease and shorten your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: There just isn't much compelling evidence about vitamins despite decades of study. They make sense on an intellectual level, but the benefits are not clearly visible in repeatable studies. A well-formulated multivitamin is probably benign and not doing you any harm or good either way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Matt Singer at Dissolve has a sharp post on &lt;a href="http://thedissolve.com/news/25-please-hollywood-no-more-bad-fake-american-accents/" title="Please Hollywood, No More Fake American Accents"&gt;the rise of Europeans doing flat American accents in blockbuster films&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bale is from the United Kingdom as well, and variations of his flat, husky whisper—like a guy with a bad case of laryngitis and a mild speech impediment—have become the de facto “American” voice for a lot of foreign born Hollywood action heroes. Scottish Gerard Butler used it earlier this year as a Secret Service agent in Olympus Has Fallen; Australian Sam Worthington deployed it with varying degrees of success in Avatar and Terminator Salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What annoys me most about this particular fake accent is that it robs characters' voices of depth and subtlety. &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim&lt;/em&gt; is a tremendously fun and goofy film, but its lead character has the vocal range of a robot. Jokes and important moments feel off because the actor is stuck talking like a stoic, Clint Eastwood cowboy rather than like a real person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not opposed to Brits and Europeans doing American accents, but the Bale voice is simply too flat and dreary to work for most films.&lt;/p&gt;
